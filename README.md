## Project Overview

This E-Commerce project aims to create a fully functional (not too much focused on UI) online shopping platform. Users can browse through various products, add them to their cart, make purchases, and manage their orders. Admin users have access to a dashboard where they can manage products, inventory, orders, and customer information.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React (with Redux for state management)
- Backend: Node.js (Express.js)
- Database: MongoDB
- Payment Integration: Razorpay
- Material UI
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Libraries: axios, bcrypt, express-validator, jsonwebtoken, mongoose, vite

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ajay-Maury/MERN-E-Commerce-Project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd MERN-E-Commerce-Project
```

3. Install backend and frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
cd Ecommerce-Frontend
npm install
```

### Backend Configuration

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` in the `backend` directory.
2. Open the `.env` file in the `backend` directory.

3. Configure your MongoDB connection URL and JWT secret key:

   ```dotenv
   # MongoDB Connection URI
   MongoDB_URI=your_mongodb_uri

   # JWT Secret Key
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```

4. Add your Razorpay API Key and Secret:

   ```dotenv
   # Razorpay API Key and Secret
   Razorpay_Key_Id=your_razorpay_key_id
   Razorpay_Key_Secret=your_razorpay_key_secret
   ```

Your `.env` file should now look something like this:

```dotenv
MongoDB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name
JWT_SECRET_KEY=yoursecretkey12345
Razorpay_Key_Id=your_razorpay_key_id
Razorpay_Key_Secret=your_razorpay_key_secret
```

Ensure that you replace `your_mongodb_uri`, `your_jwt_secret_key`, `your_razorpay_key_id`, and `your_razorpay_key_secret` with your actual values.

This configuration allows the backend to establish a connection to your MongoDB database, manage user authentication using JWT, and integrate with Razorpay for payment processing.

For reference, you can use the provided `env.example` file as a template when creating your `.env` file. Make sure not to share your actual sensitive keys and secrets in public repositories.

## Usage

1. Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run start
```

2. Start the frontend development server:

```bash
cd Ecommerce-Frontend
npm run dev
```

Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
